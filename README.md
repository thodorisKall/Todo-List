# React Todo List

## Goal of the Project

The primary objective of this project is to learn and reinforce fundamental concepts of React. This includes JSX, props, states, Create React App (CRA), components, useState, useEffect, as well as event handlers such as onChange and onClick. By building a Todo List application that implements the CRUD operations, i have a practical, hands-on way to apply and understand these concepts.

## Live Demo

You can check out the live version of the project [here](https://todo-list-livid-mu.vercel.app/).

## Description

This is a simple Todo List application built with React, HTML, and CSS. Users can create tasks, read and view existing tasks, check off completed tasks, and delete tasks. It's a perfect tool for improving productivity and task management.

## Outcome

Through this project, users can gain a firm understanding of how to structure a React application and handle state with hooks, as well as how to create and manage components. The project covers everything from setting up a new Create React App project to handling user input and updating the state.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- HTML: Standard markup language for creating web pages
- CSS: Stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML

## Future Vision

The vision for this project is to make it fully responsive, enhancing its accessibility and user experience on all types of devices. Additionally, i plan to implement an update/change task functionality, allowing users to not only create, read, check, and delete tasks but also modify existing ones.
